    <h2 class="section-title">Symptoms</h2>

    <p>Most often the symptom of a rope or cord is a lack of movement and freedom in our life. And the most common symptom of a label is a nagative message about our identity.</p>




    <h2 class="section-title">Treatment</h2>

    <p>The treatment for ropes or cords is to cut them away. And the treatment for labels or curses is to loosen the adhesive with heat. Allow Jesus to administer healing to you by asking this series of questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Jesus, please cut away anything that is an unhealthy rope or cord.</li>
      <li>Please remove any labels or curses with your fire.</li>
      <li>What lie was that injury trying to tell me?</li>
      <li>What truth do you want to replace that lie with?</li>
    </ol>




    <h2 class="section-title">References</h2>

    <p>"Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace." Ephesians 4:3</p>
    <p>"Hi own iniquities entrap the wicked man, and he is caught in the cords of his sin." Proverbs 5:22</p>
    <p>"Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest." Proverbs 26:2</p>




    <h2 class="section-title">Detail</h2>

    <p>
      Adhesives are a category of various kinds of things that all have one thing in common, they stick. Proverbs 5:22 talks about
      a situation where people get stuck. It says "the cords of their sins hold them fast". Ropes are one kind of thing that can
      get us stuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another sticky kind of thing is a label or sticker. A label is an adhesive piece of paper or plastic that lets us
      write things on the front. We often use the word label as a verb, to "label" something. The bible uses the word "curse" to mean
      the same thing. Proverbs 26:2 says "Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow, and undeserved curse does not come to rest".
      If a curse comes to rest, it stays...or sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would someone want to achieve by tying something? To prevent it from moving. And the goal of sticking a label on something is
      to help identify it. The way to respond to things that tie us up is to cut them. And the way to remove things like labels and stickers
      is to heat the adhesive and loosen it's grip.
