    <h2 class="section-title">Symptoms</h2>

    <p>
      The symptoms of a puncture wound can vary, depending on the object that caused the injury. But usually
      a person will experience an initial sharp pain. Then, depending on several factors, a person might experience
      prolonged pain and discomfort. But sometimes a person might not experience any pain whatsoever. Some puncture
      wounds are accompanied by a toxic substance which may cause additional symptoms.
    </p>




    <h2 class="section-title">Treatment</h2>

    <p>
      The treatment for a puncture wound involves three steps. First, the object is removed.
      Then any toxin or infection is cleaned and/or removed. Then finally the wound itself is closed. Allow Jesus to administer healing to you by asking this series of questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Jesus, please remove all projectiles that have caused me injury.</li>
      <li>Please sterilize all wounds with your living water and healing oil.</li>
      <li>Please close all open wounds.</li>
      <li>What lie was that injury trying to tell me?</li>
      <li>What truth do you want to replace that lie with?</li>
    </ol>




    <h2 class="section-title">References</h2>

    <p>"They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim cruel words like deadly arrows." Psalms 64:3</p>
    <p>"Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is one who gives false testimony against a neighbor." Proverbs 25:18</p>




    <h2 class="section-title">Detail</h2>

    <p>
      Psalm 64:3 mentions how poeple can "bend their bows to shoot their arrows - bitter words". Our words
      can, in fact, wound and pierce through our outer layers. And the recipient of our arrows doesn't
      have to be nearby, either. Psalm 64 goes on to say that the people bending their bows can
      "shoot in secret". There are a number of different kinds of projectiles that can be used. The bible
      metions things like darts, arrows and spears. But the common thing about all these is that they're
      used from a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different projectiles can affect us differently like their real world counterparts. Needles and darts
      are used as more of an nuisance and impediment. Medium sized projectiles are used to injure and slow
      it's target. And longer weapons like spears are meant to reach deep down. And some of these projectiles
      can be fired with other things like poison or fire to increase the injury they cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      TThe treatment for the injuries caused by a spiritual projectile has three steps. The first step is to
      remove the projectile. Then the injury needs to be sterilized in the case that the projectile carried a
      toxin or fire. And lastly, the wound needs to be closed up.
