    <p>Not applicable.</p>




    <h2 class="section-title">Treatment</h2>

    <p>The treatment for waste materials is to purge them with heat, then wash with water. Allow Jesus to administer healing to you by asking this series of questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Jesus, please apply your cleansing fire to any mud or contaminants.</li>
      <li>Please wash me with your living water.</li>
      <li>What lie was that injury trying to tell me?</li>
      <li>What truth do you want to replace that lie with?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="section-title">Detail</h2>

    <p>
      Proverbs 25:26 talks about "muddied springs" and "polluted wells". A well and a spring are both places where
      someone would go to get the cleanest water naturally available. But if the spring or well was contaminated,
      a person would have to either do extra work to clean the water or risk their health being impacted. James 1:27
      tells us to "keep oneself from being polluted". In addition to the health risk, if a water supply were to become
      sufficiently polluted, it may even become obstructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We experience spiritual symptoms when we've become muddied or polluted. Proverbs 25:26 talks about a righteous person
      "giving way" to the wicked. If we encounter situations where we're not able to stand up for things that are right,
      we may just have a place in our spirit that has been clogged or muddied.
    </p>
    <p>
      When people are out camping or hiking and they need to drink water found in nature, there is a real risk of drinking
      water that has bacteria in it. The way to avoid contracting an illness due to bacteria is to boil the water before
      drinking it. And spiritual mud and pollution is treated in like manner. Isaiah realized that he was contaminated when
      he encountered the Lord. What was the remedy? An angel brought coals that were used to cleanse Isaiah.
