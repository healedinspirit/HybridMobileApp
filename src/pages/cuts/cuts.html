      <p>The treatment for a cut is to use heat to help the wound close and heal. Allow Jesus to administer healing to you by asking this series of questions:</p>
      <ol class="healing-steps">
        <li>Jesus, please sterilize any cuts with your living water and healing oil.</li>
        <li>Please close any open wounds.</li>
        <li>What lie was that injury trying to tell me?</li>
        <li>What truth do you want to replace that lie with?</li>

        In Psalms 64:3 it talks about people who "sharpen their tongue like a sword". In the section on heat injuries, we discussed how words like
        lips, mouth or tongue refer to the words we say because those are the parts of our body we use to speak with. The statement in Psalms 64 is
        letting us know that words can wound and cut, at times deeply.
      </p>
      <p class="subject-card-detail">
        Cuts to our physical body primarily cause pain and discomfort. And cuts to our spirit have the same symptom. However, our spirit is slightly different
        than our body. Ephesians 5:18 tells us to "be filled with the Holy Spirit". Imagine that you filled a plastic bag full of water, but then you cut a
        whole in the side of the bag. The water would start running out and you could only fill the bag as high as the opening. Our spirit functions much like that.
        When we're cut by other's words, we're not able to be as full, and tend to feel dry and empty.
      </p>
      <p class="subject-card-detail">
        The way God applies healing to cuts and lacerations is using heat. The heat will help the cut to close up and be restored to normal. When you're ready,
        click GO to ask the Lord to heal any cuts and lacerations.
