    <h2 class="section-title">Symptoms</h2>

    <p>The symptoms of a callus is an area of hardness and a loss of sensitivity to stimulus.</p>




    <h2 class="section-title">Treatment</h2>

    <p>The treatment for a callus is to soften and rehydrate the damaged area with oil. Allow Jesus to administer healing to you by asking this series of questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Jesus, please apply your healing oil to any callused areas.</li>
      <li>What lie was that injury trying to tell me?</li>
      <li>What truth do you want to replace that lie with?</li>
    </ol>




    <h2 class="section-title">References</h2>

    <p>"Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is one who gives false testimony against a neighbor." Proverbs 25:18</p>
    <p>"Like a man who throws firebrands, arrows, and death, is the man who deceives his neightbor, and says, 'I was only joking'." Proverbs 26:18</p>
    <p>"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit." Psalms 34:18</p>




    <h2 class="section-title">Detail</h2>

    <p>
      In Proverbs 25:18 it says "A man who bears false witness against his neighbor is <span style="font-weight:700;">like a club</span>, a sword or a sharp arrow".
      This verse says that bearing false witness can be like three different kinds of weapons, but for this section, we're going to focus on calluses, most
      likely from a dull weapon like a club. Proverbs 26:18 says "A lying tongue hates those who are crushed by it". Psalms 34:18 says that "the Lord saves those who
      are crushed in spirit".
    </p>
    <p>
      When we are suffering in our spirit from a club injury, the result is a callus. A callus represents
      a hardened area on our insides. A callus injury will give us the impression that we have to harden
      ourselves in order to protect ourselves from further injury. But is that really what happens?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's consider a physical callus to see just what the real effect is. A physical callus is an area of
      skin that is hardened and tough. That may partially protect the area with the callus, like, for example, on
      our feet. But the callus is also hard and inflexible and will crack easily. And that's the real
      effect of a callus on our spirit. When we want to move and bend in our expression to the Lord, a callused
      area will crack open and cause pain and discomfort.
