      <p>The treatment for a callus is to soften and rehydrate the damaged area with oil. Allow Jesus to administer healing to you by asking this series of questions:</p>
      <ol class="healing-steps">
        <li>Jesus, please apply your healing oil to any callused areas.</li>
        <li>What lie was that injury trying to tell me?</li>
        <li>What truth do you want to replace that lie with?</li>

      <p class="subject-card-detail">
        In Proverbs 25:18 it says "A man who bears false witness against his neighbor is <span style="font-weight:700;">like a club</span>, a sword or a sharp arrow".
        This verse says that bearing false witness can be like three different kinds of weapons, but for this section, we're going to focus on calluses, most
        likely from a dull weapon like a club. Proverbs 26:18 says "A lying tongue hates those who are crushed by it". Psalms 34:18 says that "the Lord saves those who
        are crushed in spirit".
      </p>
      <p class="subject-card-detail">
        When we are suffering in our spirit from a club injury, the result is a callus. A callus represents
        a hardened area on our insides. A callus injury will give us the impression that we have to harden
        ourselves in order to protect ourselves from further injury. But is that really what happens?
      </p>
      <p class="subject-card-detail">
        Let's consider a physical callus to see just what the real effect is. A physical callus is an area of
        skin that is hardened and tough. That may partially protect the area with the callus, like, for example, on
        our feet. But the callus is also hard and inflexible and will crack easily. And that's the real
        effect of a callus on our spirit. When we want to move and bend in our expression to the Lord, a callused
        area will crack open and cause pain and discomfort.
