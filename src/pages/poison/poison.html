      <p>The treatment for toxic substances in our spirit is to remove them in order to cease their effects on us. Allow Jesus to administer healing to you by asking this series of questions:</p>
      <ol class="healing-steps">
        <li>Jesus, please remove all poison from my spirit.</li>
        <li>Please close up any open wounds that allowed the poison in.</li>
        <li>What lie was that injury trying to tell me?</li>
        <li>What truth do you want to replace that lie with?</li>

      <p class="subject-card-detail">
        Romans 3:13 mentions how some people can get to where "the poison of vipers is on their lips".
        Our words, represented with words like lips, mouth or tongue, can affect others in much the
        same way as poison would affect our body. Poison is often in a liquid or other form that our
        body is capable of ingesting. And often times a weapon is used to inject a poison within our
        internal tissues.
      </p>
      <p class="subject-card-detail">
        The most common symptom of having our spirits poisoned is when we're not able to release a
        person or situation where we encountered hurt or pain. The main intended use of spiritual poison
        is to keep us stuck in the situation within which we were hurt. And it's also intended to
        make the original pain even worse.
      </p>
      <p class="subject-card-detail">
        The treatment for encountering a poisonous substance in our spirit is not unlike what we see
        in the medical community. Doctors will typically want to first sterilize any areas that they
        are able to access. And then they'll usually administer a medication that will neutralize the
        toxin that we're affected by. In that same way, our spirits first need to be washed. Then the
        poisononous thinking can be neutralized.
