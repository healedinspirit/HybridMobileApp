    <h4>A Glimpse Inside</h4>
    <p padding-right>
      We've all experienced some level of pain and hurt on the inside, in our spirit. Just look at how much time and money is spent on self help and
      counseling. But in our efforts to heal, we run into an obvious barrier. We can't always observe what happens to us on the inside. Our soul
      and spirit aren't always visible to us. And because of that, our efforts to heal may have varying amounts of effectiveness.
    </p>
    <p padding-right>
      The medical community faced a similar challenge in their efforts to provide physical healing. What exactly is happening to people on the inside? If they could only
      see inside the human body, they could give patients much more accurate diagnoses as well as more effective treatments. Eventually, however,
      equipment was invented that allowed doctors to observe the injuries people experienced on the inside. First it was XRay machines. Then eventually MRI
      machines were invented. Those, along with other kinds of inventions, gave doctors a view into the internal workings of the human body. And with the
      advent of new equipment, the effectiveness of medical treatments increased dramatically.
    </p>
    <p padding-right>
      If only there was something like an MRI machine, but for our soul and spirit. Well, there is! God has elaborated on the inner workings of our spirit in His
      message to us, the Bible. For starters, we find this quote in the Bible "No weapon formed against you will prosper" Isaiah 54:17.
      The obvious point to this statement is that...weapons are being formed against us. And weapons are intended to cause pain and injury.
      What kind of weapons are these? Psalms 64:3 mentions people who "sharpen their tongues like
      swords and aim cruel words like deadly arrows". Somehow or another, our words can cause pain and injury to each others spirit.
    </p>
    <h4>Injuries on the inside are much like injuries on the outside</h4>
    <p padding-right>
      In the Healed In Spirit app, we cover many different types of injuries, and their healing. The way in which our spirit experiences
      an injury is much like the way our body experiences an injury. For example, one kind of injury is a cut or laceration that is accompanied by sharp pain.
      A cut in our spirit is often accompanied by sharp pain as well. The difference between the two lies in the nature
      of our spirit. Our spirit functions kind of like a water glass that might be clear, but holds a liquid. If you were to cut a hole in the side
      of a water glass, the water would drain out and only be able to fill to the level of the hole. The same goes for a cut in our spirit. We'll
      often experience a sense of draining or emptying after our spirit is cut by a sharp object.
    </p>
    <h4>Spiritual injuries have spiritual healing</h4>
    <p padding-right>
      The treatements available for healing our spirit bear a striking resemblance to physical healing treatments. James 3:6 says that "the tongue is a fire".
      Our words can cause spiritual injures by increasing the temperature to excessive levels.
      The treatment for a heat injury on the inside is much like the treatment to a heat injury on the outside.
      For a physical heat injury, one might apply cooling water, then regenerative lotion.
      John 7:38 says that the Holy Spirit is likened to "living water".
      And 1 Samuel 16:13 records that the Holy Spirit is also like oil. By having the Holy Spirit tend to our injuries, We get very immediate and
      lasting relief from pain and injuries to our spirit!
    </p>
    <h4>Injuries send a negative message</h4>
    <p padding-right>
      Injuries cause pain and discomfort. But did you know they communicate messages? Communicating doesn't always require words in order for them to be effective.
      Injuries, whether physical or spiritual, carry an intended message, and not one that's positive. Some spiritual injuries cause obvious pain and suffering.
      Those injuries speak their message loudly. Other injuries are meant to hide the message deep in our thinking, so deep we don't realize we're thinking it.
      But either way, they communicate something. When you perform the healing activities throughout this app, you'll ask Jesus what lie was being communicated
      by the injury so you can recognize it...and discard it!
    </p>
    <h4>Healing sends a positive message</h4>
    <p padding-right>
      Jesus would love for us to be healed and whole. Since healing is available for each and every injury, that tells us that negative messages don't have to have
      the final say. If we resist the urge to give negative messages permission to stay, we can experience lasting relief and a hopeful frame of mind.
    </p>
    <h4>Get immediate relief!</h4>
    <p padding-right>
      By following the treatment plan in this app, you'll experience the healing that's available for you.
      In each section, you'll learn more about different kinds of injuries. You'll then be given a sample prayer to
      receive healing from Jesus. Click the button to get started!
