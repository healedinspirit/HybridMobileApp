    <br/>
    <h2 class="section-title">Symptoms</h2>
    <p>The most common symptom of a heat injury is an immediate sharp pain followed by a loss of feeling in the exposed area.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Treatment</h2>
    <p>The treatment for a heat injury is, first, to heal the injured area with oil, then restore anything that was lost in the injury. Allow Jesus to administer healing to you by asking this series of questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Jesus, please apply healing oil to all injured areas.</li>
      <li>Please restore any injured areas.</li>
      <li>What lie was that injury trying to tell me?</li>
      <li>What truth do you want to replace that lie with?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="section-title">References</h2>
    <p>"The tongue is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body." James 3:6</p>
    <p>"Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?" Proverbs 6:27</p>
    <p>"...whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron." 1 Timothy 4:2</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Detail</h2>
    <p>
      We read in James chapter 3 where it tells us that "the tongue is a fire".
      If our words are a fire, that means we can release too much heat
      to ourselves and others by the way that we talk. Heat injuries can also
      be caused by other kinds of things as well. Proverbs 6 likens immorality
      to "taking fire into our laps". And 1 Timothy talks about people who's
      consciences were "seared with a hot iron".
    </p>
    <p>
      When people experience a physical heat injury, there are potentially three
      symptoms that result. One is an immediate sharp pain from the heat that
      caused the injury. The second symptom is the damaged tissue. And the third
      is a loss of feeling. When people experience too much heat in their
      spirit, they can potentially experience all three of those as well. But
      the most common intended symptom is the loss of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two common treatments for a physical heat injury. The first
      step is to cool the injury by running it under cold water. That is
      followed by applying oil or lotion to help the skin rejuvenate.
      And the treatment for our spirit is much the same.
      In John 7:38,39, the Holy Spirit is likened to "living water".
      And in 1 Samuel 16:13, when a prophet anointed someone with oil, the
      Holy Spirit came upon that person.
