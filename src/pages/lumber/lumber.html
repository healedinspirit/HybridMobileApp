    <h2 class="section-title">Symptoms</h2>

    <p>Not applicable.</p>




    <h2 class="section-title">Treatment</h2>

    <p>The treatment for building with combustible building materials is to remove them with heat. Allow Jesus to administer healing to you by asking this series of questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Jesus, please apply your fire to all wood, hay or straw in my spirit.</li>
      <li>Please wash me with your living water.</li>
      <li>What lie was that injury trying to tell me?</li>
      <li>What truth do you want to replace that lie with?</li>
    </ol>

      "If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw,
      their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be
      revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person's work." 1 Corinthians 3:12,13
    </p>
    <p>"First take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye." Matthew 7:5</p>




    <h2 class="section-title">Detail</h2>

    <p>
      First Corinthians 3:12 mentions the idea that we could build our lives with "wood, hay or straw".
      And Matthew 7:3 talks about how we can end up with wooden planks in our eye. 1 Corinthians
      3:12 also mentions three other building materials, "gold, silver and gems". When we're
      building the house of our lives, how do we decide which materials to use? 1 Corinthians 3:13
      mentions that the quality of our works will be tested, so our choice of building materials
      will make a real difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key to choosing the right materials to build with is hidden in 1 Corinthians 3:13 and 14.
      First, it says that our choice of materials will be tested with fire. Materials that can endure
      heat get a reward, but materials that can't endure heat won't be rewarded. What happens to
      materials like wood, hay or straw in a fire? They get burned up and turn to ash. What happens
      to gold, silver and gems in heat? They may melt, but they don't burn up and turn to a less useful
      material like ash.
